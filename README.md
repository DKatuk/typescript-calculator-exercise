# TYPESCRIPT CALCULATOR APP

This project is developed as a TypeScript practice exercise.

The project utilizes the **readline-sync** package to facilitate a user-friendly console conversation. Make sure to install the **types/readline-sync** package as well, as it provides type definitions for TypeScript.

## Main Objective

The main objective of this practice app is to build a calculator using TypeScript, reinforcing the understanding of TypeScript concepts such as data types, functions, and conditional statements.

## Getting Started

1. `npm install -g typescript`

2. Run `npm install` to install all other dependencies.

3. Run `node index` to test the app in your console.

4. In the terminal, type numbers and operators to perform calculations. The calculator app checks if the entered values are numbers or operators and provides the result accordingly.
